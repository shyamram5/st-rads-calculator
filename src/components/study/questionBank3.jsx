    question: "A 17-year-old boy presents with a painful, enlarging mass in the popliteal fossa. MRI reveals a 5.5 cm mass that is uniformly T2 hyperintense (100% show this finding). Peritumoral edema is present. The 'triple sign' is noted — areas of high, intermediate, and low signal on T2-weighted images. ADC shows restricted diffusion (mean 0.95 × 10⁻³ mm²/s).\n\nWhich diagnosis should be MOST strongly suspected?",
    options: ["Rhabdomyosarcoma", "Synovial sarcoma", "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor", "Epithelioid sarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Synovial sarcoma: uniform T2 hyperintensity (100%), peritumoral edema (73-96%), and the 'triple sign' (high, intermediate, and low T2 signal representing solid tumor, hemorrhage, and calcification/fibrosis). Adolescent/young adult juxta-articular location (popliteal fossa) is classic. Despite the name, synovial sarcoma does not arise from synovium. ST-RADS 5 with urgent tissue diagnosis."

    question: "A 30-year-old woman presents with a painless mass in the posterior thigh. MRI reveals a 6 cm well-defined deep-seated mass that is markedly T2 hyperintense with avid homogeneous enhancement. Prominent flow voids are identified within and around the mass (78-96% demonstrate this finding). No perilesional edema.\n\nWhich rare sarcoma is characterized by this combination?",
    options: ["Epithelioid sarcoma", "Clear cell sarcoma", "Alveolar soft part sarcoma", "Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Alveolar soft part sarcoma: prominent flow voids (78-96%) reflecting marked vascularity are its most distinctive feature. T2 hyperintense, young adults (20-40), commonly lower extremity. Flow voids distinguish it from most other sarcomas. Despite indolent growth, ASPS has high rates of late pulmonary metastasis. ST-RADS 5 with tissue diagnosis and systemic staging."

    question: "A 35-year-old man presents with a 4 cm painless mass in the distal forearm near the wrist. MRI shows a well-defined mass that is T2 intermediate (not markedly hyperintense). The lesion extends along a tendon and demonstrates avid homogeneous enhancement. ADC is 0.9 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. On review, a subtle 'checkerboard' pattern of alternating signal is noted on T2.\n\nGiven the distal extremity location and young age, which sarcoma should be suspected?",
    options: ["Synovial sarcoma", "Epithelioid sarcoma", "Clear cell sarcoma", "Fibrosarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Epithelioid sarcoma has a predilection for distal upper extremity in young adults, often along tendons/aponeuroses. It demonstrates peritumoral edema in 100% of cases, low ADC, and can be deceptively bland-appearing. The distal extremity location distinguishes it from most other sarcomas. Epithelioid sarcoma is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign process (granuloma, nodular fasciitis) due to its small size and superficial location. ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with a slow-growing mass on the dorsum of the foot. MRI shows a 3 cm well-defined mass intimately associated with a tendon. The lesion demonstrates T1 hyperintensity (brighter than muscle) and T2 hyperintensity. Enhancement is avid. The mass has well-defined margins with a lobulated contour.\n\nThe T1 hyperintensity in this location raises concern for which specific sarcoma?",
    options: ["Synovial sarcoma", "Clear cell sarcoma (melanoma of soft parts)", "Epithelioid sarcoma", "Extraskeletal osteosarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Clear cell sarcoma (melanoma of soft parts) has a predilection for tendons/aponeuroses of the foot and ankle. The intrinsic T1 hyperintensity is due to melanin content (similar to melanotic melanoma). This is a critical diagnostic clue — most soft-tissue sarcomas are T1 isointense to muscle. Combined with the tendon association and foot location, clear cell sarcoma must be considered. ST-RADS 5. Pre-contrast fat-suppressed T1W is essential to distinguish melanin from fat."

    question: "A 20-year-old man presents with a 7 cm mass in the anterolateral thigh. MRI demonstrates a heterogeneous mass with multiple fluid-fluid levels. T2 signal is mixed with areas of marked hyperintensity and areas of T2 hypointensity. Post-contrast images show heterogeneous enhancement of the solid components. ADC is 0.85 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nMultiple fluid-fluid levels in a solid soft-tissue mass suggest which underlying process?",
    options: ["Multiple cysts with proteinaceous content", "Hemorrhagic necrosis within an aggressive neoplasm (ABC-like changes)", "Organized hematoma from trauma", "Myxoid degeneration in a benign tumor"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Multiple fluid-fluid levels within a solid, enhancing soft-tissue mass indicate hemorrhagic necrosis, often seen in aggressive sarcomas with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst-like (ABC-like) changes. This pattern can be seen in synovial sarcoma, UPS, and other high-grade sarcomas. The solid enhancing components, low ADC, and young age suggest an aggressive malignancy. This is NOT a simple hematoma (which would lack solid enhancing components). ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 6-year-old boy presents with a rapidly growing mass in the orbit causing proptosis. MRI demonstrates a 3 cm homogeneous mass that is T2 hyperintense, T1 isointense to muscle, with avid homogeneous enhancement. The mass molds around orbital structures without bone destruction. ADC is 0.7 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: ["Lymphoma", "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma", "Dermoid cyst", "Capillary hemangioma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common orbital malignancy in children, presenting with rapid proptosis. Key features: homogeneous enhancement, T2 hyperintensity, molding around structures, and very low ADC reflecting high cellularity. The orbit/head-neck region is the most common site for embryonal subtype. ST-RADS 5 with urgent tissue diagnosis and pediatric oncology referral."

    question: "A 16-year-old boy presents with a painless mass in the forearm. MRI reveals a 5 cm mass in the volar compartment that is T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense to muscle. The mass demonstrates a 'bowl of grapes' morphology with multiple lobulated components. Post-contrast images show avid heterogeneous enhancement. Some components show restricted diffusion (ADC 0.8 × 10⁻³) while others do not.\n\nWhich subtype of this tumor is most likely given the patient's age?",
    options: ["Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma", "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma", "Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma", "Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma peaks in adolescents (10-25 years) and favors the extremities, unlike embryonal which favors head/neck in younger children. The 'bowl of grapes' lobulated morphology, heterogeneous enhancement, and variable ADC are characteristic. Alveolar subtype carries a worse prognosis than embryonal. The extremity location in an adolescent strongly favors alveolar over embryonal. ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 55-year-old man presents with a 10 cm deep thigh mass. MRI shows a large heterogeneous mass with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The viable tumor shows heterogeneous T2 signal and avid enhancement. No specific MRI pattern allows confident histologic subtyping. ADC is 0.8 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The mass crosses fascial compartments.\n\nThis imaging appearance is MOST consistent with which diagnosis?",
    options: ["Myxofibrosarcoma", "Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)", "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma", "Leiomyosarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS, formerly MFH) is a diagnosis of exclusion — a high-grade sarcoma without a specific line of differentiation. Its imaging is nonspecific: large, deep, heterogeneous mass with necrosis, hemorrhage, and low ADC. The absence of specific diagnostic features (no fat for liposarcoma, no flow voids for ASPS, no characteristic sign) combined with aggressive features (trans-compartmental extension, necrosis) is actually the 'signature' of UPS. ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 50-year-old woman is 3 months post-radiation therapy for a thigh sarcoma. MRI demonstrates diffuse soft-tissue edema, skin thickening, and mild enhancement in the radiation field. Within the tumor bed, there is no discrete mass or focal restricted diffusion. ADC values in the treatment bed are elevated at 1.8 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nWhat ST-RADS category applies?",
    options: ["ST-RADS 5 — Enhancement in the tumor bed is suspicious", "ST-RADS 6A — Expected post-radiation changes without tumor", "ST-RADS 6B — Possible residual tumor", "ST-RADS 0 — Cannot evaluate due to radiation changes"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Post-radiation changes at 3 months include diffuse edema, skin thickening, and mild enhancement — all expected findings. The KEY is: no discrete mass, no focal restricted diffusion, and elevated ADC (1.8 × 10⁻³). This is ST-RADS 6A. The elevated ADC indicates edema and tissue damage rather than residual tumor (which would show low ADC). Serial imaging will be needed to monitor for recurrence."

    category: "Post-Treatment",
    question: "A 48-year-old man underwent wide local excision of a synovial sarcoma 18 months ago. Surveillance MRI shows a new 1.5 cm nodule in the surgical bed that was not present on the 12-month scan. The nodule is T2 hyperintense, avidly enhancing, with ADC of 0.95 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nThis NEW nodule in a previously clear surgical bed should be classified as:",
    options: ["ST-RADS 6A — Could be post-surgical granulation tissue", "ST-RADS 6B — Small residual/recurrent tumor, stable", "ST-RADS 6C — New nodule represents recurrence until proven otherwise", "ST-RADS 3 — Probably benign reactive change"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "A new enhancing nodule with restricted diffusion (ADC 0.95 × 10⁻³) in a previously clear surgical bed at 18 months post-resection of synovial sarcoma represents ST-RADS 6C (recurrent disease) until proven otherwise. New solid, enhancing, diffusion-restricting lesions in a sarcoma surgical bed cannot be dismissed as post-surgical change, especially when they appear de novo on interval imaging. Urgent tissue diagnosis is warranted."

    category: "Post-Treatment",
    question: "A 60-year-old woman is being monitored after resection of an atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT/WDL). At 2-year follow-up, MRI shows a 3 cm enhancing mass in the deep surgical bed with ADC of 1.0 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The mass does NOT contain fat signal. On the prior scan at 18 months, the mass was 2 cm.\n\nWhat is the most concerning aspect of this finding?",
    options: ["The 50% size increase (2→3 cm) exceeds the 20% threshold for 6C", "The absence of fat signal suggests dedifferentiation rather than recurrent WDL", "The ADC of 1.0 is in the malignant range", "All of the above are concerning"],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "All findings are concerning. The 50% size increase exceeds the 20% threshold for ST-RADS 6C. More importantly, the absence of fat signal in a recurrence from an originally lipomatous tumor suggests dedifferentiation — transformation from WDL to dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which dramatically worsens prognosis. The ADC of 1.0 × 10⁻³ supports high cellularity. This combination warrants urgent tissue diagnosis — the non-lipomatous component should be biopsied."

    question: "A 25-year-old woman presents with a 4 cm mass in the knee region, adjacent to the joint capsule but extra-articular. MRI shows a predominantly solid mass with areas of calcification (T1/T2 hypointense foci) and cystic components. The mass demonstrates the 'bowl of grapes' morphology. Post-contrast images show heterogeneous enhancement. ADC is 0.9 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nThe calcification pattern on MRI is important because:",
    options: ["Calcification excludes malignancy", "Calcification is rare in soft-tissue masses and should raise concern for synovial sarcoma", "All juxta-articular calcified masses are chondromatosis", "Calcification indicates prior treatment"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Calcification in a soft-tissue mass, especially in a juxta-articular location in a young adult, should raise concern for synovial sarcoma. Approximately 30% of synovial sarcomas show calcification on imaging. The combination of calcification, cystic components, juxta-articular location, young age, and low ADC is highly suspicious. Synovial chondromatosis shows multiple loose bodies within the joint, not a solid mass. ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 40-year-old man presents with a 5 cm mass in the medial thigh. MRI shows a well-defined mass with a predominantly myxoid appearance (T2 very hyperintense) and solid enhancing nodular components at the periphery. The myxoid areas do not enhance; the solid nodules enhance avidly. ADC of the solid components is 1.0 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: ["Intramuscular myxoma with surrounding edema", "Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma", "Myxoid liposarcoma", "Ganglion cyst"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) demonstrates a characteristic pattern: predominantly myxoid/cystic-appearing areas (high water content of myxoid matrix) with solid enhancing nodular components, typically at the periphery. Unlike intramuscular myxoma (which is uniformly myxoid without solid nodules) or myxoid liposarcoma (which shows enhancing septations throughout), EMC has discrete solid nodules within a myxoid stroma. ST-RADS 4-5 depending on aggressiveness of features."

    question: "A 55-year-old man had a soft-tissue sarcoma resected from the thigh 5 years ago. He has been disease-free on surveillance. Current MRI shows a new 2 cm mass in the opposite (contralateral) thigh that demonstrates T2 hyperintensity, enhancement, and ADC of 0.95 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nHow should this contralateral mass be classified?",
    options: ["ST-RADS 6C — Distant recurrence in the contralateral extremity", "ST-RADS 5 — New mass assessed independently, not as recurrence", "ST-RADS 3 — Probably benign in a different location", "ST-RADS 4 — Suspicious but not proven malignant"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A new mass in the contralateral extremity is NOT classified in the category 6 pathway — that is reserved for the original surgical bed. This new mass should be assessed independently using the standard ST-RADS 1-5 categories. Given its suspicious features (enhancement, ADC <1.1), it warrants ST-RADS 5 classification. It could represent a second primary sarcoma, metastasis, or an unrelated pathology. Tissue diagnosis is needed."

    question: "A 65-year-old woman presents with a 12 cm deep mass in the retroperitoneum. MRI demonstrates a heterogeneous mass with areas that are T2 hyperintense and others that are T2 hypointense. The mass shows heterogeneous enhancement with areas of necrosis. No fat component is identified. ADC of the solid portion is 0.75 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The mass appears to arise from the psoas muscle.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: ["Dedifferentiated liposarcoma", "Leiomyosarcoma", "Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma", "Lymphoma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Leiomyosarcoma (smooth muscle origin) is the most common primary retroperitoneal sarcoma after liposarcoma. Arising from the psoas muscle, a heterogeneous mass with necrosis, mixed T2 signal (reflecting cellular and fibrous areas), and very low ADC is characteristic. The absence of a fat component argues against liposarcoma. Retroperitoneal leiomyosarcomas tend to be large at diagnosis. ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 50-year-old man presents with a 3 cm well-defined mass in the foot. MRI shows a solid mass that is T1 hyperintense (brighter than muscle but not as bright as fat) and moderately T2 hyperintense. On fat-suppressed sequences, the T1 hyperintensity persists (does not suppress). Enhancement is avid. ADC is 0.85 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nThe persistent T1 hyperintensity on fat-suppressed images is MOST suggestive of:",
    options: ["Fat-containing lesion with failed fat suppression", "Melanin-containing lesion (consider clear cell sarcoma or melanoma metastasis)", "Proteinaceous cyst", "Subacute blood products (methemoglobin)"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "T1 hyperintensity that persists on fat suppression excludes fat as the cause. In a solid mass with low ADC in the foot, this pattern strongly suggests melanin — raising concern for clear cell sarcoma (melanoma of soft parts) or melanoma metastasis. Clear cell sarcoma favors tendons/aponeuroses of the foot and ankle. The melanin shortens T1 (paramagnetic effect). This is why ST-RADS mandates pre-contrast fat-suppressed T1W — it distinguishes melanin/blood from fat. ST-RADS 5."

    question: "A 45-year-old woman had chemotherapy and radiation for a high-grade sarcoma. Post-treatment MRI shows the mass has decreased from 8 cm to 5 cm. The previously heterogeneous mass now shows predominantly high T2 signal (fluid-like) with thin peripheral enhancement. ADC has increased from 0.8 to 1.6 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nWhat do these changes indicate?",
    options: ["Tumor progression — the persistent mass is concerning", "Good treatment response — increased ADC indicates cell death/necrosis", "Pseudoprogression — will resolve spontaneously", "Infection in the treatment bed"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Increased ADC (0.8→1.6 × 10⁻³) after treatment indicates cell death and necrosis — a marker of good response. The T2 hyperintensity represents necrotic/liquefied tumor, and thin peripheral enhancement suggests a treatment cavity rather than viable tumor. Size decrease (8→5 cm) further supports response. This is ST-RADS 6B (residual tumor present but responding). Viable residual tumor would show persistent low ADC and avid solid enhancement."

    question: "A 19-year-old man presents with a 6 cm mass in the paravertebral muscles. MRI demonstrates a well-defined mass with markedly heterogeneous signal — areas of T1 hyperintensity (fat), T2 hyperintensity (fluid/cystic), and areas of solid tissue with intermediate signal. Post-contrast images show enhancement of the solid components. Calcification is present.\n\nThe combination of fat, fluid, solid tissue, and calcification in a single mass is MOST characteristic of:",
    options: ["Liposarcoma", "Teratoma (dermoid)", "Hemangioma with thrombus", "Sarcoma with heterogeneous differentiation"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A mass containing fat, fluid, solid tissue, and calcification — all four tissue types — is characteristic of teratoma (mature or immature). Mature teratomas (dermoids) contain derivatives of all three germ layers. The paravertebral location in a young patient is consistent. While retroperitoneal and sacrococcygeal are more common locations, paravertebral teratomas occur. The multi-tissue composition distinguishes this from all other entities. ST-RADS classification depends on whether mature (2-3) or immature (4-5)."

    question: "A 55-year-old woman has a 3 cm intramuscular lesion in the calf. MRI shows homogeneous T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, no enhancement, and ADC of 2.5 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The lesion has a thin, imperceptible wall and is unilocular. It does NOT communicate with the joint.\n\nThe very high ADC (2.5 × 10⁻³) suggests:",
    options: ["Restricted diffusion — very aggressive tumor", "Free water diffusion — simple cystic/fluid lesion", "Artifact — ADC cannot be this high", "Intermediate cellularity — ST-RADS 3"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "ADC of 2.5 × 10⁻³ mm²/s reflects free water diffusion, consistent with a simple cystic/fluid lesion (the ADC of pure water is approximately 3.0 × 10⁻³). Combined with no enhancement, homogeneous T2 hyperintensity, and thin wall, this is a simple intramuscular cyst — ST-RADS 2. The very high ADC essentially excludes any solid cellular neoplasm. Remember: higher ADC = less restriction = more free water = more likely benign/cystic."

    question: "A 28-year-old woman presents with a 2.5 cm subcutaneous nodule in the lower leg. MRI shows a well-defined, lobulated mass with marked T2 hyperintensity and a 'tail' of signal extending along a neurovascular bundle. Post-contrast images demonstrate avid enhancement. ADC is 1.0 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nThe 'tail' extending along a neurovascular bundle is important because:",
    options: ["It confirms a benign process following anatomic planes", "It may represent perineural spread of a malignant tumor", "It is a normal finding in all subcutaneous masses", "It indicates lymphatic drainage from an inflamed mass"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A 'tail' of signal extending along a neurovascular bundle in a solid enhancing mass with borderline ADC should raise concern for perineural/perivascular spread — a feature of certain malignancies including epithelioid sarcoma and MPNST. This is distinct from the fascial tail sign (fascial plane spread, classic of myxofibrosarcoma). Neurovascular bundle extension is particularly concerning in the setting of low-to-borderline ADC. ST-RADS 4-5 depending on other features."

MRI shows a heterogeneous mass with necrosis, perilesional edema, and ADC of 0.8 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The mass was not present on imaging 2 years ago.\n\nWhat diagnosis must be considered?",
    options: ["Recurrence of the original malignancy", "Radiation-induced sarcoma (secondary sarcoma)", "Post-radiation fibrosis with degeneration", "Myositis ossificans from radiation"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) typically occurs ≥3 years after radiation (median 10-15 years) within the radiation field. A new aggressive mass (necrosis, edema, low ADC) in a previously irradiated field 15 years post-treatment is classic. The most common types are UPS, osteosarcoma, and angiosarcoma. This is a distinct entity from the original malignancy. ST-RADS 5 with urgent tissue diagnosis. RIS carries a poor prognosis."

    explanation: "HLRCC (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, also called Reed syndrome) presents with cutaneous leiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas (women), and risk for aggressive renal cell cancer and leiomyosarcoma. The presence of cutaneous leiomyomas with a deep muscle mass suspicious for leiomyosarcoma should prompt consideration of this syndrome. Genetic testing for fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation is warranted. The mass itself is ST-RADS 5."

MRI reveals a 6 cm mass within the gastrocnemius muscle that demonstrates predominantly T2 hyperintensity with a central area of T2 hypointensity and peripheral enhancement. On T1, the mass shows isointensity with a rim of T1 hyperintensity. There is surrounding edema. ADC is 1.3 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nThe combination of T1 hyperintense rim with evolving T2 signal changes suggests:",
    options: ["Hemorrhagic sarcoma — the T1 rim represents tumor capsule", "Evolving intramuscular hematoma — the T1 rim represents peripheral methemoglobin", "Myxoid tumor — the T1 rim indicates proteinaceous content", "Abscess — the T1 rim represents the pyogenic membrane"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A peripheral rim of T1 hyperintensity surrounding a mass with evolving T2 signal changes is the classic pattern of peripheral methemoglobin in a subacute-to-chronic intramuscular hematoma. The T2 central hypointensity may represent deoxyhemoglobin (acute) or concentrated intracellular methemoglobin. ADC of 1.3 is intermediate. This is ST-RADS 3 with mandatory follow-up at 6-8 weeks to confirm resolution. Failure to resolve warrants upgrade — some sarcomas hemorrhage."

MRI demonstrates a well-defined mass with a unique 'double line sign' — a peripheral rim of T2 hypointensity surrounded by an outer rim of T2 hyperintensity. The central mass is intermediate T2 signal. Post-contrast images show avid enhancement of the central component.\n\nThe 'double line sign' is MOST classically associated with which condition?",

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "The 'double line sign' pattern in a soft-tissue mass — peripheral low signal (mature calcification/ossification) with inner higher signal — suggests myositis ossificans. The zonal maturation pattern (mature bone peripherally, immature tissue centrally) is characteristic and distinguishes it from extraskeletal osteosarcoma (which shows central, not peripheral, ossification). This 'zoning phenomenon' is key to avoiding misdiagnosis of this benign reactive condition as malignancy. ST-RADS 2-3."

The mass demonstrates alternating bands of T1 hyperintensity (fat) and T1 intermediate signal (fibrous strands). T2 shows a similar banded pattern. Minimal enhancement. The left side shows a similar but slightly smaller lesion.\n\nWhat is the SINGLE most useful clinical/imaging feature that confirms the diagnosis?",
    options: ["Size >5 cm warrants biopsy regardless", "Bilateral, symmetric subscapular location is pathognomonic for elastofibroma dorsi", "Enhancement pattern determines malignancy risk", "ADC values are needed for classification"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Bilateral, symmetric subscapular masses with a banded pattern of fat and fibrous tissue are pathognomonic for elastofibroma dorsi. No other entity presents this way. The location alone (deep to scapula, between serratus anterior and chest wall) combined with bilateral symmetry (66%) makes the diagnosis with virtually 100% confidence.

The mass is intimately associated with the tendon. Post-contrast images show avid enhancement. A small satellite nodule is seen 2 cm proximal along the tendon.\n\nWhat diagnosis combines the tendon association, satellite nodule, and imaging characteristics?",
    options: ["Giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (TGCT)", "Clear cell sarcoma with satellite nodule", "Xanthoma", "Tendon fibroma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Clear cell sarcoma has strong tendon/aponeurosis tropism, particularly in the foot/ankle region (Achilles tendon). The T1 hyperintensity (melanin) and satellite nodules along the tendon are characteristic features. Satellite nodules indicate local spread along tendons — a hallmark of clear cell sarcoma. Unlike TGCT (which shows hemosiderin and blooming), clear cell sarcoma lacks hemosiderin. ST-RADS 5 with tissue diagnosis. Clear cell sarcoma has high rates of lymph node metastasis."

    question: "A 58-year-old woman is undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for a high-grade sarcoma. Pre-treatment MRI showed a 10 cm mass with ADC of 0.7 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, the mass measures 9.5 cm (minimal size change), but ADC has increased to 1.4 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nWhat is the clinical significance of the ADC change despite minimal size reduction?",
    options: ["ADC increase without size change indicates treatment failure", "ADC increase reflects tumor necrosis — this is a favorable early response marker", "ADC changes are unreliable during chemotherapy", "The mass should be reclassified as benign (ADC >1.1)"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "ADC increase (0.7→1.4 × 10⁻³) reflects cell death and necrosis — a favorable early response marker that often precedes size reduction. Tumor necrosis from chemotherapy increases extracellular water, raising ADC values. This is an important principle: ADC change can detect treatment response before RECIST size criteria show change. Continued treatment with expectation of further size decrease is appropriate. ADC is increasingly used as an early biomarker of chemotherapy response in sarcomas."

    question: "A radiologist is protocoling an MRI for a suspected soft-tissue mass. The lesion is in the forearm. Previous CT showed a 4 cm mass.\n\nAccording to ST-RADS, what is the recommended slice thickness and field of view?",
    options: ["1 mm slices, tight FOV around the mass only", "3-4 mm slices with 10% gap, FOV to cover the entire compartment", "5-7 mm slices, large FOV covering the entire extremity", "Any slice thickness is acceptable as long as contrast is given"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "ST-RADS recommends 3-4 mm slice thickness with a 10% gap for optimal resolution without excessive scan time. The field of view should cover the entire anatomic compartment (not just the mass) to assess compartmental extent, skip lesions, and neurovascular involvement. Too-thin slices increase scan time and noise; too-thick slices miss small features. The entire compartment assessment is crucial for surgical planning."

    question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with a 5 cm mass in the thigh. MRI shows a well-defined mass that is T2 intermediate (not markedly hyperintense), T1 isointense, with moderate homogeneous enhancement. ADC is 1.2 × 10⁻³ mm²/s. The mass has smooth margins and no aggressive features (no edema, necrosis, or tail sign).\n\nThe intermediate T2 signal (not markedly bright) narrows the differential. Which tumors characteristically show this pattern?",
    options: ["Myxoid tumors (myxoma, myxoid liposarcoma) which are all markedly T2 bright", "Fibrous tumors (desmoid, SFT, fibrosarcoma) which contain dense collagen", "Vascular tumors which show flow voids", "Nerve sheath tumors which show the target sign"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Intermediate T2 signal (not markedly bright) is characteristic of fibrous/collagenous tumors — desmoid fibromatosis, solitary fibrous tumor, fibrosarcoma, and other fibroblastic neoplasms. Dense collagen creates lower T2 signal compared to myxoid tumors (which are markedly T2 bright due to high water content). This is an important observation: T2 signal intensity helps categorize the tumor 'family' and narrow the differential. The ADC of 1.2 is intermediate — ST-RADS 3-4."

    question: "A 55-year-old man presents with a 3 cm mass in the hand. MRI shows a well-defined mass arising between the metacarpals. The mass demonstrates the 'bowl of fruit' sign — multiple small rounded areas of variable signal (T2 bright, T2 dark, and intermediate) creating a multicolored appearance. Some areas show ring enhancement. There is mild surrounding edema.\n\nThis imaging pattern is most suggestive of:",
    options: ["Giant cell tumor of tendon sheath", "Soft-tissue chondroma (enchondroma protuberans)", "Synovial sarcoma", "Epithelioid sarcoma"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Soft-tissue chondroma in the hand shows variable signal reflecting cartilaginous matrix heterogeneity: T2 bright (hyaline cartilage), T2 dark (calcification), and intermediate (fibrous areas). Ring enhancement around cartilaginous lobules is characteristic, similar to enchondromas in bone. The hand/foot is the most common location. This is typically ST-RADS 2-3. The key differentiator is the location (hand) and ring-and-arc enhancement pattern typical of cartilaginous lesions."

    question: "A 42-year-old woman presents with a 2 cm painful mass in the plantar aspect of the foot. MRI shows a well-defined nodule within the plantar fascia. The lesion is T1 isointense and T2 hypointense (darker than muscle). Enhancement is mild. ADC is 1.1 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis and what does the T2 hypointensity indicate?",
    options: ["Plantar fibroma (Ledderhose disease) — T2 dark from dense collagen", "Foreign body granuloma — T2 dark from calcification", "Morton neuroma — T2 dark from perineural fibrosis", "Plantar melanoma — T2 dark from melanin"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Plantar fibroma (Ledderhose disease, plantar fibromatosis) presents as a well-defined nodule within the plantar fascia that is characteristically T2 hypointense due to dense collagen content. This is the plantar equivalent of Dupuytren disease (palmar fibromatosis). The T2 hypointensity indicates mature fibrous tissue. This is ST-RADS 2 — a benign condition that may be observed or treated with local excision if symptomatic."

    question: "A 60-year-old man presents with a 15 cm mass in the thigh. MRI demonstrates a highly heterogeneous mass with the following pattern: approximately 40% is fatty (T1 bright, suppresses on FS), 35% is solid non-lipomatous tissue (T2 intermediate, enhancing, ADC 0.85 × 10⁻³), and 25% is necrotic. The fatty and non-fatty components are geographically distinct (side by side) rather than intermixed.\n\nWhat is the most important biopsy consideration?",
    options: ["Biopsy the fatty component — it represents the dominant tissue", "Biopsy the necrotic area — it contains diagnostic information", "Biopsy the non-lipomatous solid component — it determines tumor grade", "Any single biopsy location is equivalent"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "In a mass with geographically distinct fatty and non-fatty components, the non-lipomatous solid tissue must be biopsied because it determines grade and prognosis. This pattern is classic for dedifferentiated liposarcoma — the fatty component represents WDL while the non-fatty component represents the high-grade dedifferentiated area. Biopsying only the fatty component would yield a diagnosis of WDL, missing the more aggressive dedifferentiated component. This is a critical management principle."

    question: "A 33-year-old woman presents with a painless mass in the posterior thigh. MRI shows a 4 cm well-defined, encapsulated mass that demonstrates a striking 'split fat sign' — a thin rim of fat surrounding the lesion (bright on T1, dark on fat suppression). The lesion itself is homogeneously T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, with moderate enhancement. No edema or aggressive features. ADC is 1.6 × 10⁻³ mm²/s.\n\nThe split fat sign is MOST useful for identifying:",
    options: ["Any intramuscular mass — all deep masses show this sign", "Nerve sheath tumors — fat surrounding a fusiform intramuscular mass indicates neural origin", "Lipomatous tumors — the fat rim represents the tumor capsule", "Metastatic disease — fat displacement around implanted tumor cells"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "The split fat sign — a thin rim of fat surrounding a fusiform intramuscular mass — indicates that the lesion is displacing the normal intramuscular fat around itself, characteristic of nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas and neurofibromas). Combined with homogeneous T2 hyperintensity, encapsulation, and ADC >1.5, this is a benign PNST — ST-RADS 2. The split fat sign helps identify neural origin even when the parent nerve is not discretely visible. It is not specific to all intramuscular masses."
